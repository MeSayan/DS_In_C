# DS_In_C
Implementing common data structures in C (for added challenge :D)


## List of Implemented Data Structures

1. Hash Set -> Array of Linked Lists based implementation ✔
2. Hash Map -> Array of Linked Lists based implementation ✔
3. Binary Heap -> Array based implementation ✔


## Upcoming data structure implementations
1. Change binary heap implementaion to have dynamic array so that heap grows if needed. However amortized logarithmic complexity should be maintained in all operations. **[WIP]**
2. Graph DS 
3. Segment Tree
3. Fenwick Tree
